# Scribe Standard Library

Top-level modules planned for v0.1:
- `core`: Option, Result, ownership traits
- `text`: string utilities
- `file`: filesystem primitives
- `time`: clocks and sleep
- `http`: async client/server
- `json`: serialization helpers

Each subdirectory will eventually become a Scribe package once the language is self-hosting.
